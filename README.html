            <p>Hello, I am Kaushik Vada. As a college student interested in engineering, mathematics, and computer science, I hope to contribute my skills and abilities to the world. I have challenged myself in such areas through my involvement in Hackathons, state/national competitions, and leadership roles in my school's engineering and science clubs. To give back my collective experience to the community that has helped me learn, I teach and help younger students in my areas of interest to guide them to achieve their future potential.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning and programming in C++, HTML, CSS, and Java</li>
                <li>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities and creating projects to showcase my growing skills in my learning programming languages.</li>
