Hello, I am Kaushik Vada. As a college student interested in engineering, mathematics, and computer science, I hope to contribute my skills and abilities to the world. I have challenged myself in such areas through my involvement in Hackathons, state/national competitions, and leadership roles in my school's engineering and science clubs. To give back my collective experience to the community that has helped me learn, I teach and help younger students in my areas of interest to guide them to achieve their future potential.
